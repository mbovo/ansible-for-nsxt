# Ansible for NSX-T

# Overview
This repository contains NSX-T Ansible Modules, which one can use with Ansible to work with [VMware NSX-T Data Center][vmware-nsxt]. [vmware-nsxt]: https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html
For general information about Ansible, visit the [GitHub project page][an-github]. [an-github]: https://github.com/ansible/ansible
Documentation on the NSX platform can be found at the [NSX-T Documentation page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html)

This repository is a fork of the original one in order to give the community fast access to some features VMWare forgot or was too lazy to implement.... for examples support for NSX-T 2.3.x, tagging, router reditributions and so on. It also provide better automatic integration in the case you want to build a Kubernetes Cluster on top of NSX-T networking.
